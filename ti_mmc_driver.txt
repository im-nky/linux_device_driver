Role of probing in TI linux mmc driver: 

- Detects and matches the AM654 SDHCI controller using the device tree.
- Initializes platform structures and memory-mapped I/O registers.
- Configures and enables the clock for the controller.
- Parses MMC properties from the device tree.
- Sets up tuning functions for high-speed SD card operation.
- Enables runtime power management and autosuspend.
- Handles errors gracefully by rolling back initialization.
